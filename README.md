# LifeSim
The windows-only GUI implementation of conway's game of life with some additions.  
I made it via WinForms and right now its in active development.  
I'm not accepting any pull requests yet.  
And also releases will release after I finish all the changes I'm making, and at least get to 1.0 version.  
I only used vs2022 for it, and I dont know how it will be edited in other IDEs.

# How to compile?
I only used vs2022 on this, so just opening the solution is enough.  
Visual studio will do the job.  

# Important
The project is still being actively developed, thats why it may not even run.  

# Vendors/Dependencies
I used:
* WinForms
* Gdi+ library, built-in C#
